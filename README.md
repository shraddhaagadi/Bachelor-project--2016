Secret Door Knock Pattern Recognition

The project idea was to build a knock detecting door lock which can identify the specific knocking pattern and unlock the door if the pattern is correct. This door knocking system provides much security than systems which are currently using. When there are many users who use the door, problems may occur because there is only one key to open to door. But there is this door locking system this kind of problems may not occur because the users who may know the knocking pattern can open the door anytime without a key.
The aim of this project is that secret door knocker uses a piezo element to record and detect your secret knock pattern, then turns a servo motor that you can connect to your door lock. Press the button to record a knock pattern, and then test it by knocking.
